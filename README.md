A clean, modern Wayland-centric development environment centered around:
- hyprland (Wayland compositor)
- foot (fast, minimal terminal emulator)
- zsh with oh-my-zsh (shell and ergonomics)
- neovim (modal editor configured in Lua)

These dotfiles aim for a productive, minimal, and keyboard-first workflow with sensible defaults and clear structure, designed for a mostly terminal workflow.

- Supported and tested on:
  - Asahi Linux (Fedora-based on Apple Silicon)
  - Ubuntu

---

## Key components

- hyprland: tiling, window rules, and keybindings
- foot: styling
- zsh + oh-my-zsh: aliases, plugins, completions, prompt

## Installation

Simply clone the repository and use the setup.sh script located in dotfiles_setup directory for a guided install.

What the script typically does (review it first):
- Installs common dependencies and tools.
- Symlinks selected modules into your home directory.
- Sets Zsh as your default shell and installs oh-my-zsh.
- Can offer to install fonts (e.g., JetBrains Mono Nerd Font).
